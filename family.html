Family
</p>

<p>
This is my family on Senior night. I am very thankful for them with all the support they have given me throughout my athletic and school career. My mother on the right, Katherine, is very loving and supportive in all of my endeavors. My sister Riley is very kind and plays hockey as well. Then there is my father, Pat. This man is the sole reason of who I am today and couldn't imagine my life without him.
